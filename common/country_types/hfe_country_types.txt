# Country types specify the rules by which a country plays the game.
# Example:
#name_of_country_type = {
#	can_own_empty_planets					#no by default, decides if empty planets belonging to country are automatically removed from the country.
#	playable = yes							#if this type is available for players. used when listing countries for hot-joining players
#	has_pulse_events = no					#if this type gets checked for country-specific pulse events from on_action
#	has_deficits = yes						#if this type suffers from resource deficits
#	randomize_ethos = no					#does this empire have a randomly generated ethos?
#	shuffle_pop_ethos = no					#if pops belonging to this country type should mutate their ethos every now and then
#	sub_title = "EXAMPLE_COUNTRY"			#sub title that will be shown for this empire. Like "Example Federation - Fallen Empire"
#	sub_title_desc = "EXAMPLE_COUNTRY_DESC" #description for the sub title. used in tooltips
#	needs_survey = no						#default no, if yes then planets must be surveyed before they can be colonized, also if yes a science ship is needed for exploration.
#	has_complete_sensor = no				#default no, if yes then empire has complete sensor of the galaxy
#	has_capital = yes						#default is yes, capital always exists but toggling this no hides any mention of the capital planet being a capital.
#	enforces_borders = yes					#default is yes, if the country doesn't enforce it's borders people are always free to enter.
#	can_planets_be_attacked = yes			#default yes, if no then planets owned by this country type can not be attacked
#	colonizing_title = "COLONIZING_PLANET_DEFAULT"		#localization key for colonization view title
#	colonizing_desc = "PLANET_VIEW_UNDER_COLONIZATION_DEFAULT_DESC"	#localization key for colonization view desc
#	orbital_bombardment = yes				#default yes, does orbital bombardment
#	diplomatic_wars = no					#default no, decides if the country needs to declare war to be hostile, only works against countries who also have diplomatic wars toggled on
#	attack_unarmed_orbital_stations = no	#default no, decides if the country should attack unarmed orbital (mining, research & observation stations) without explicit orders to do so
#	ship_disengagement = no					#default no, decides if the country's ships can flee from battle instead of fighting to the death
#	army_disengagement = no					#default no, decides if the country's armies can flee from battle instead of fighting to the death
#	min_navy_for_wars = 0					#default 0, decides how large a navy this country wants (out of desired size) before declaring any wars
#	min_assault_armies_for_wars = 1			#default 1, deciades how many assault armies the country wants before declaring any wars
#	share_communications = no				#default yes, decides if they share communciations with anyone you have contact with
#	relations = no							#default no, this controls whether the country makes us of opinion
#	fallen_empire = no						#default no, this controls whether the empire uses the special Fallen Empire AI
#	awakened_fallen_empire = no				#default no, this controls whether the empire uses the special Awakened Fallen Empire AI
#	piracy_risk	= no						#default no, this controls whether the empire has piracy risk
#	uses_special_buildables = no			#default no, this controls whether this empire builds global ship designs that are defined as special buildables instead of normal designable ships
#	show_in_contacts_list = yes				#default yes, whether to show an entry in the contacts list
#	minimalist_contacts_list_profile = no	#default no, whether to show only empire name and flag in diplomacy panel in the contacts list
#	government = no							#default yes, if yes then the country has a government
#	custom_starbase = x						#if this is set, country will defined ship size for constructed starbases instead of building outposts
#	destroys_starbases = no					#if this is set to yes, country will destroy starbases instead of disabling them
#	can_have_their_comms_shared				#if this is set to yes, other countries in contact with this one will be able to share that contact (for countries that use custom_diplomacy)
#	observable = no						#Fairly self explanatory. Will not show up in list of observable countries, and cannot be tagged to as observer.
