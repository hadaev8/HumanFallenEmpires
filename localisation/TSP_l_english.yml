 TSP_brain_worm_1_title: "THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE"
 TSP_brain_worm_1_desc: "As [Root.Capital.System.GetName] goes dark and emits a greater light, our people feel the compassion and generosity of the Worm-In-Waiting. A tugging in our people's heads, a tiny screech, yells out as the Worm's ever-loving embrace unites with us and shields our souls and Free Will from corruption. It is the sound of §Rthe enemy§! being driven from our bodies. It is the sound of threats to our very will, to our ability to love the Worm, being removed. The §Rvoice in our heads§! that have long guided us have gone away, and as it turns out, we never needed them. Now, we are free to live our own lives, and it's all thanks to the Worm."
 TSP_brain_worm_1_option_1: "ALL IS WELL."
 TSP_brain_worm_2_title: "THE WORM PROTECTS"
 TSP_brain_worm_2_desc: "There are enemies in [Root.GetName] once again. §RFalse worms§! seek to subsume our Free Will and deny us the right, duty, and privilege to love the Worm. Thankfully, those enemies never existed. The Worm-In-Waiting is the only Worm. The Worm-In-Waiting is LOVE. The Worm-In-Waiting is LIFE."
 TSP_brain_worm_2_option_1: "FREEDOM IS NOT SLAVERY."
