 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.0.1:0 "Interesting! You have found our ancient subspace passage. You do not mind if we close it, right? Don't worry, we'll send you home when we're through."
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.1:0 "We have not always been like this. To become who we are today, we had to be forged through blood and despair. Millenia ago, our primitive ancestors were kidnapped by a sinister race called the §PAhets,§! to be used for building a colony. Stolen from our homelands and pressed into slavery, we had prepared to resign ourselves to hopelessness. Just when we had given up, we were suddenly freed, and the colony hadn't even been fullly established! Short time of our enslavement had passed when §PRa§! Himself, in His blazing chariot, led a rebellion and unleashed His Wrath on our foes! With His help, we destroyed the colonial ship-turned-capitol and slaughtered our former masters.\nThe remaining Ahet survivors were put to labor and our people utilized what was left of their technology to progress our civilization. So our journey began."
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.2:0 "We fought and won our freedom, taking pride in our victory, but pride became arrogance and we gradually forgot our gods. Consumed by the thirst for knowledge, we pushed our ambitions to every corner of the galaxy. It was the Golden Age of our people's civilization, for we unraveled many mysteries of the universe. We visited fascinating worlds and built wonderful cities where life had once been impossible.\nOne thousand years ago, we finally located our ancient homeworld, in the §PSol System,§! and on the beautiful planet §PEarth§! we found the remnants of our kind in a primitive state, and we decided not to disturb them. We haven't visited Sol since then."

 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.3.1:0 "Soon, the Gods put us to another trial. We faced a great foe, a detestable race we dubbed the Cylons, but whom you probably know as the Daleks. Our great nation stood up to defend the Galaxy. In the end, we defeated and purged these creatures from everywhere under the light of §PRa.§!"
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.4:0 "Much knowledge had been lost, but more important was the memory reattained - of who we are. Only under the protection of true gods and eternal values could our dreams shape this universe. Thus reborn from ashes, we lit a new sun, built colonies anew and raised the pyramids. Under the guidance of the §PGreat Pharaoh,§! the prophet of §PRa,§! we welcome the New Life."

 human_fallen_empires.100.desc:0 "Most of the planet's surface is covered with various smoke-belching factories. It would appear that some of them are being used as places of worship. Huge craters from explosions, resembling bruises and sores, are scattered across the landscape. Most likely they are remnants of a global war that raged here centuries ago.\nBecause of extreme pollution, there is little to no vegetation except for several pieces of land covered by protective domes. The oceans and rivers are filled with toxins and rusty scraps of metal. The atmosphere is unsuitable for unaided breathing due to the high level of contamination. Toxic smoke emits from thousands of factories that the world's population considers a manifestation of the divine, and so they continue to keep them running without producing anything. Despite the extreme airborne toxicity, they have adapted, and according to our agents, even mundane maintenance like the replacement of the breathing filters have become part of the society's elaborate religious rituals. Likewise, simpler safety procedures such as wearing face-masks to allow the population to breathe safely have gained religious signifigance."

One of the spies assigned to study the natives managed to seize a shipment of spare filters for us to study, which revealed a surprising secret. All of the population's air filters are spiked with drugs! Every filter contains a potent mixture that our scientists have dubbed Valerian, which causes severe hallucinations when inhaled. The population's regular "revelations of the gods" turned out to be nothing more than t he result of a mind-altering substance! Unnoticed by the population, we have made contact with the High Mechanicus and have revealed his secret. He knows that releasing this information to the public may destroy the Cult.\nThe High Mechanicus is now our puppet. How are we going go exploit this?"

 human_fallen_empires.104.0.response:0 "Year 386 after The Fall. Possibly I am the last of the Engineer corps. I record this so that those who come after will remember that we, the §PVarelez,§! were a proud and ambitious race. We reached for the stars and strived to know as much as we can. We've been curious, fearless and aspiring. Once on our journeys, we crossed paths with the §PJu Ahet§! civilization. A trail of misunderstandings, combined with a little of our pride and overconfidence, led to a great war which consumed hundreds of star systems. Turns out, we were the weaker ones. This planet was our last bastion, but eventually we had nothing to defend it with. In hopes of surviving the fiery Hell unleashed by their fleet, we descended into caves. Years later, they finally left our planet."

 human_fallen_empires.104.1.response:0 "The remains of our kind began to rebuild our cities, but we were changed by the stress of defeat and the looming fear that one day the §PJu Ahet§! may come back. We had no interest for stars anymore. A §PCult of the Machine-That-Speaks-To-God§! spread throughout our ranks, claiming that our knowlege became the reason of our defeat, and that, as penance, our production modules must be converted to machines that will cloud the atmosphere and convince the §HJu Ahet§! that we no longer remained alive. We listened to them willingly, trying to forget our loss. In time, there was no place among us where this accursed cult was not in charge. \nThe greatest of our production modules became their §PGodforge,§! simply called §P"The Factory",§! now closed and forbidden. That became the only source of science in our midst. The Cult then began hunting down and executing any surviving engineers, and teaching a "doctrine of Forgetness" instead of education. I am unable to change anything. Most of my comrades are gone or deceased. My only choice is to freeze myself in cryostasis, chasing the hope that, one day, I might serve and enlighten my people once again."

It seems the Varelez are now ready to return to reason and sense. There is a long process of asking the right questions and seeking answers ahead. How to fix the biosphere? How do machines work if not with the help of the divine? Is there any life beyond our world? However, these troubles are no longer ours."

The analysis showed that the pyramid is a huge isolated database. Apparently, those who built this pyramid believed that it was necessary to not save embalmed bodies, as their tradition say, but instead to save all information about them, including a mold of the deceased individual. The last block of this peculiar burial ground contains a matrix of the personality of a young, male alien. The personality was transfered to our terminal."

 human_fallen_empires_civic_brainworm_desc:0 "A Brain Worm, also called the "Had's Worm", is a species of tiny parasitic lifeform that considers itself to be the pinnacle of all evolution. Deeming itself the only species worthy of ruling the galaxy, but unable to do so in its natural body, it instead locates and infects a host- a vessel -and acts as a "voice" in its head, slowly convincing its host to serve it. Vessels of the Brain Worm are allowed to retain their Free Will and are convinced by the Brain Worm to serve it. In late stages of the infestation, the Brain Worm is fully capable of assuming direct control of its host, though most hosts are fully willing to serve by then out of their own desire.  \n \nDespite not needing to do so, Brain Worms prefer to use charisma and persuasion to convince their hosts to do their bidding, and they offer great benefits to those who submit. The Brain Worm is an enticing, charismatic being that offers power and pleasure to its host. The infected, in essence, are made immortal and the potential of their minds is unlocked, but they become completely infertile. In the end, most vessels agree that the deal was worth it. \n§RNote:§! This means a Brain Worm vessel can't reproduce, which dramatically increases the difficulty of the game."
