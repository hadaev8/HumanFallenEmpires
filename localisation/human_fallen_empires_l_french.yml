 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.0.1:0 "Interesting! You have found our ancient subspace passage. You do not mind if we close it, right? Don't worry, we'll send you home when we're through."
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.1:0 "We have not always been like this. To become who we are today, we had to be forged through blood and despair. Millenia ago, our primitive ancestors were kidnapped by a sinister race called the §PAhets,§! to be used for building a colony. Stolen from our homelands and pressed into slavery, we had prepared to resign ourselves to hopelessness. Just when we had given up, we were suddenly freed, and the colony hadn't even been fullly established! Short time of our enslavement had passed when §PRa§! Himself, in His blazing chariot, led a rebellion and unleashed His Wrath on our foes! With His help, we destroyed the colonial ship-turned-capitol and slaughtered our former masters.\nThe remaining Ahet survivors were put to labor and our people utilized what was left of their technology to progress our civilization. So our journey began."
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.2:0 "Nous nous sommes battus et avons gagné notre liberté, fiers de notre victoire, mais la fierté est devenue arrogance et nous avons progressivement oublié nos dieux. Consummé par la soif de la connaissance, nous avons poussé nos ambitions dans tous les coins de l'Univers. C'était l'âge d'or de la civilisation de notre peuple, car nous avons démêlé beaucoup de mystères de l'Univers, visité des mondes fascinants et construit des villes merveilleuses où la vie été impossible.\nNous avons même localisé notre ancien monde natal, dans le §PSol System,§! et sur une magnifique planète §PEarth§! nous avons trouvé les restes de notre espèce dans leur état primitif, que nous avons décidé de ne pas déranger."

Our great nation stood up to defend the Galaxy. In the end, we defeated and purged these creatures from everywhere under the light of §PRa.§!"
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.4:0 "Much knowledge had been lost, but more important was the memory reattained - of who we are. Only under the protection of true gods and eternal values could our dreams shape this universe. Thus reborn from ashes, we lit a new sun, built colonies anew and raised the pyramids. Under the guidance of the §PGreat Pharaoh,§! the prophet of §PRa,§! we welcome the New Life."

 human_fallen_empires.100.desc:0 "Most of the planet's surface is covered with various smoke-belching factories. It would appear that some of them are being used as places of worship. Huge craters from explosions, resembling bruises and sores, are scattered across the landscape. Most likely they are remnants of a global war that raged here centuries ago.\nBecause of extreme pollution, there is little to no vegetation except for several pieces of land covered by protective domes. The oceans and rivers are filled with toxins and rusty scraps of metal. The atmosphere is unsuitable for unaided breathing due to the high level of contamination. Toxic smoke emits from thousands of factories that the world's population considers a manifestation of the divine, and so they continue to keep them running without producing anything. Despite the extreme airborne toxicity, they have adapted, and according to our agents, even mundane maintenance like the replacement of the breathing filters have become part of the society's elaborate religious rituals. Likewise, simpler safety procedures such as wearing face-masks to allow the population to breathe safely have gained religious signifigance."

One of the spies assigned to study the natives managed to seize a shipment of spare filters for us to study, which revealed a surprising secret. All of the population's air filters are spiked with drugs! Every filter contains a potent mixture that our scientists have dubbed Valerian, which causes severe hallucinations when inhaled. The population's regular "revelations of the gods" turned out to be nothing more than t he result of a mind-altering substance! Unnoticed by the population, we have made contact with the High Mechanicus and have revealed his secret.

 human_fallen_empires.104.0.response:0 "Year 386 after The Fall. Possibly I am the last of the Engineer corps. I record this so that those who come after will remember that we, the §PVarelez,§! were a proud and ambitious race. We reached for the stars and strived to know as much as we can. We've been curious, fearless and aspiring. Once on our journeys, we crossed paths with the §PJu Ahet§! civilization. A trail of misunderstandings, combined with a little of our pride and overconfidence, led to a great war which consumed hundreds of star systems. Turns out, we were the weaker ones. This planet was our last bastion, but eventually we had nothing to defend it with. In hopes of surviving the fiery Hell unleashed by their fleet, we descended into caves. Years later, they finally left our planet."

We had no interest for stars anymore. A §PCult of the Machine-That-Speaks-To-God§! spread throughout our ranks, claiming that our knowlege became the reason of our defeat, and that, as penance, our production modules must be converted to machines that will cloud the atmosphere and convince the §HJu Ahet§! that we no longer remained alive. We listened to them willingly, trying to forget our loss. In time, there was no place among us where this accursed cult was not in charge. \nThe greatest of our production modules became their §PGodforge,§! simply called §P"The Factory",§! now closed and forbidden. That became the only source of science in our midst. The Cult then began hunting down and executing any surviving engineers, and teaching a "doctrine of Forgetness" instead of education. I am unable to change anything. Most of my comrades are gone or deceased. My only choice is to freeze myself in cryostasis, chasing the hope that, one day, I might serve and enlighten my people once again."

It seems the Varelez are now ready to return to reason and sense. There is a long process of asking the right questions and seeking answers ahead. How to fix the biosphere? How do machines work if not with the help of the divine? Is there any life beyond our world? However, these troubles are no longer ours."

The analysis showed that the pyramid is a huge isolated database. Apparently, those who built this pyramid believed that it was necessary to not save embalmed bodies, as their tradition say, but instead to save all information about them, including a mold of the deceased individual. The last block of this peculiar burial ground contains a matrix of the personality of a young, male alien. The personality was transfered to our terminal."

On my urgent recommendation, we forcibly seized several dozen settlements and many thousands of this race, to use them during the initial stages of the forthcoming colonization. Perhaps my expedition's branch of the §PLay Council§! was surprised when I volunteered to organize the placement and control of these savages aboard my expedition's ships.\nThe unfortunate and rapid decline of healthy §PAhets§! on our planet meant that, fortunately for the primitives, my ships had plenty of empty seating. Personally, I blame the §PLay Council.§! Without the englightening beacon of the Great Minds to organize the expedition, the §PLay Council's§! incompetence and poor planning lead our civilization to further collapse, as they acted before consulting me and my brilliant mind. Imagine how many more expeditions could have been sent off if the §PLay Council§! had let me plan the whole thing! Can a conscious citizen be blamed for scorning the repetition of history?

Needless to say, no one wanted to stay in there, which led to them unwittingly spreading it even further until the military finally got involved. I tried to speak with our §PLay Council,§! staffed mainly by the military, but I was ignored. It seems like these men are blind as *unintelligble*. Or maybe they do not see an ally in me?

In late stages of the infestation, the Brain Worm is fully capable of assuming direct control of its host, though most hosts are fully willing to serve by then out of their own desire.\n\nDespite not needing to do so, Brain Worms prefer to use charisma and persuasion to convince their hosts to do their bidding, and they offer great benefits to those who submit. The Brain Worm is an enticing, charismatic being that offers power and pleasure to its host. The infected, in essence, are made immortal and the potential of their minds is unlocked, but they become completely infertile. In the end, most vessels agree that the deal was worth it. \n§RNote:§!

This planet is not only home to self-aware civilizations of pre-FTL robots, but contains an entire ecosystem, food chain, and "biosphere" of robots that take the place of plants, animals, and all other life! By building an orbital station around this planet, we can recover the various mechanical "lifeforms" across the planet and study the "animals" and self-aware "citzens" of the planet. This will immensely benefit our Engineering Research £engineering."
